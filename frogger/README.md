frogger
=========
Part 1 of the frogger project was a little confusing because it was hard to tell exactly how much we were supposed to accomplish on this go-round.

So far, I have 2 functions. The first sets the parameters and then calls the second which draws the game board with the parameters as inputs in some cases.

The reason this will be helpful is that it breaks up the code and will be easy to update the draw function and call it constantly when the frog and the other obstacles move.

So far, that's all we really need from what I can tell. The background is drawn as close to the real thing as I could make it, and we don't need to have moving parts yet.
