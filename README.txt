===================

1. What is this course?
This course is about developing websites, web applications, and learning about the ins and outs of the web. (There is more to this class than this, and I'll get into it in #4)


2. What was your favorite project?
My favorite project was the OMFGDOGS actually. It was the first real thing I've ever created on the web, and the first time it rendered I just remember being exremely satisfied and thinking it was so cool how I had created a functioning webpage that does something relatively (loosely) useful and cool.


3. What project or lab are you most proud of?
I'm definitely most proud of A5. We obviously hadn't learned anything about MONGO or NODE, so it was really a suck it up and teach yourself kind of moment. I think I learned the most from A5, and definitely grew the most as a programmer. It was extremely frustrating at times, but going forward I'll take frustration even more in stride because of that experience.


4. How much have you grown?
I've grown a ton as a programmer and a "learner" and self-teacher. I feel that I've gained the valuable skill of basic web programming, and the even more valuable skill of self-confidence in overcoming frustrating and challenging problems in which the answer isn't immediately apparent. For this I'm most grateful. Thank you.
