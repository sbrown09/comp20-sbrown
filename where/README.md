1) Identify what aspects of the work have been correctly implemented and what have not.

I believe all aspect of the work have been correctly implemented. 
It passes the W3 HTML test, it takes the AJAX resquests and implements them as Carmen/Waldo's logos (to view their distance you must click their icons).
The page shows all of the red line stations and upon clicking them will give real time data regarding the upcoming trains.
It determines the user's location and the nearest red line T station.
It renders a polyline.
It uses a custom icon for the T stops.

2) Identify anyone with whom you have collaborated or discussed the assignment.

I collaborated a bit with Kenny Cohen. Nothing major just more macro "How did you try to do x,y,z" stuff.

3) Say approximately how many hours you have spent completing the assignment.

I probably spent somewhere in the neighborhood of 8 hours completing this assignment.
