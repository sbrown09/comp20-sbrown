==========

profile.html was the first time we used javascript in this class. It wasn't that bad, but I'm getting better at the frustrating part (which is using the internet to teach myself how to use javascript).

Overall, I enjoyed my first experience with javascript and feel like it's a lot like C++, which I am pretty comfortable with.
