jobs
=======

Lab 8 was basically just taking the original jobs lab and getting the long string from another website instead of having it already.
Once the string was retreived, it was handled the exact same to display the information on the page.

Using Ajax, this was easy, and the only issue was the security issue which we didn't have to handle.
