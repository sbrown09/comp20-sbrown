jobs
=======

There were many ways to approach this problem. It would have been easy to simply add each element of interest as it's own paragraph but that would have been boring...

What I ended up doing was to make a table for each job, with each element of interest (Company, Location, Position) as it's own row.

One issue that I feel like I faked was adding a br element after each table. There must be a real way of getting this effect, but this is what I did for now.

I'm pleased with my final product and styled it with a Matrix theme, since I watched the matrix the other day and feel like I'm on Neo's ship sometimes when I code.
